# awdev's Physics Engine
This is a pretty basic physics implementation. We have classes for 2D vectors (`Vector2`), Lines (`Line`), and Boxes (`Box`). `Box`es are made of 4 `Line`s for each side. Each `Line` is made out of 2 `Vector2`s, one for each end.

Not much else to be concerned about.

If you want to check out my implementation of physics, look at the source in `script.js`.
